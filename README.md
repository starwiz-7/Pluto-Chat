# Pluto-Chat

Pluto chat is a realtime-messaging chat application.

## Roadmap
In the next version of **Pluto-Chat**, I am planning to enhance the way of editing and creating a room.

## Built With
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) - The Web Framework used for backend
* [Flask-SocketIO](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Sockets used for realtime connection
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - The database used with Pymongo

## Installation
After cloning or downloading this github repo on the local system. 

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will install all the packages used to run the application.

## Using the app
```bash

Internet connection is a must to run the app.

The app is now live at localhost.
